# LNA design technique 
we have four primary design techniques for LNA which are reported fromt the uploaded paper that will be tested in this repostry .
1- classic noise technique 
2- simultaneous noise and input matching (SNIM)
3-power-constrained noise optimization
4- power-constrained simultaneous noise and input matching (PCSNIM)
